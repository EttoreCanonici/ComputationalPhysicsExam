# ComputationalPhysicsExam
Project for the "Computational Physics Laboratory" exam that I took in the summer of 2019.  
This includes the scipts in c used to:  
- analyze the dynamics of the tent map ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_map])  
- numerically solve the buffon's needle problem ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle_problem])  
- numerical implementation of boltzmann lattice methods ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_Boltzmann_methods])  

Additionally, written papers commenting on the results obtained are included in the project.
